# How to run:
* Open index.html in the browser & view console in dev tools - _On Chrome, you will have to run this on a server (because of CORS issues with using `fetch`). Firefox should work without having to run a server.
* The expected output is also seen in the html page.
* You can change the instructions to the Robot in `input.txt`
